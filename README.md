# Students_Database

This is one of the required projects to earn my [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/learn-sql-by-building-a-student-database-part-1/build-a-student-database-part-1) 
Relational Database Certification. 
For this project, I had to build a database creating a Bash script that uses SQL to enter information about computer science students into PostgreSQL.
